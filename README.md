# Introduction

Introduction

This README describes the overview of the overall basics of the Matplotlib package with sample code. From there, I use my newly found knowledge to display five different types of plots that can be executed by this package. For this I use the widely used Titanic Data set. This leads us onto the Cao data part of the assignment.


Alongside the README, I examine and show my workings in two separate jupyter notebooks. The first is called pyplot.ipynb and this examines the Matplotlib package while the second notebook called Cao.ipynb considers the second part of the assignment. 


In order to view the notebook you will need to download it from this repository and open it in Juypter. Jupyter notebook/lab is installed with the introduction of the Anaconda program. If unfamiliar with these programms, it is also possible to view a static version using my direct link to my git hub (https://github.com/Cossie01/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Assessment).


Furthermore, all images and reference can be located in a separate markdown file with the name References. 


## Matplotlib

The first part of the assignment is looking at matplotlib with a view of five specific plots.

Matplotlib makes graphs of arrays in Python and uses Numpy and other extention codes to provide good performance for large arrays.

Some visualisations that can be created from this package are as follows:

* Linegraphs
* Barcharts
* Histograms
* Scatterplots
* Area Plots
* Pie Charts
* Box plot
* Violin Plot
* Surface Plot

## The second part of the assignment is to view of CAO point system and using a panda data frame to compare and contrast.
